This repository contains a terrain generator I created using Processing and Perlin noise.

# Perlin Noise on Terrain Generators.

Perlin noise is used to generate terrain in computer graphics by creating a random pattern of pixels. 
This pattern can be used as a basis for more complex terrain features such as mountains and valleys. 
The noise is created by taking a group of random numbers and interpolating them to create a smooth, repeating pattern. 
These patterns can then be used to modify the geometry of terrain, or to create textures and patterns that look natural. 
This technique is often used in 3D computer graphics applications to generate realistic terrain, 
and is also used to generate realistic textures and patterns in 2D computer graphics.
